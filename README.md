# Astrum - Multi-Platform Client for [Neper](https://github.com/neper-stars/neper) API

**Astrum** (from Greek ἄστρον - "star") is a modern, desktop client
for managing Stars! game sessions via the [Neper](https://github.com/neper-stars/neper) API.

Built with Go and Wails, it provides a clean,
intuitive interface for server management,
user authentication, and game session coordination.

## Dependencies

This project makes use of the [Houston](https://github.com/neper-stars/houston) library.
And it is a client for the [Neper](https://github.com/neper-stars/neper) server.
This project embeds the excellent [stars in a browser](https://github.com/stars-4x/stars-browser)
we modified the minimum we could to create a synched filesystem
allowing astrum to push files to the browser based stars! and get
the turn files back from it.
